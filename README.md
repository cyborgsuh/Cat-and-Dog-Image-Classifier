## Cats and Dogs Image Classifier

This project implements a machine learning model to classify images as either cats or dogs. It showcases image classification techniques within the domain of computer vision.
The Cats vs. Dogs Image Classifier is built using TensorFlow and utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for accurate image classification.
The model is trained on a dataset of cat and dog images and achieves impressive accuracy in distinguishing between the two.
The Cats vs. Dogs Image Classifier demonstrates the power of machine learning in image classification tasks. It serves as a practical example of using CNNs for accurate and efficient image classification.
